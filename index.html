                    Hello 👋 ! I'm an incoming MSCSE student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My interests lie in ML/AI, specifically
                    in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was previously an Automation Engineer at Caterpillar, where I worked on sensor and physics simulations for autonomous mining vehicles. As a
                    developer, I also supported automation testing of a fleet management application and systems engineering for mine site software.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the College of Engineering, Guindy in 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I am a passionate Carnatic vocalist. Stay tuned for my music page!
