                    Hello 👋 ! I'm a first year MSCSE student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My interests lie in ML/AI, specifically
                    in Natural Language Processing. My current research at the Language and Information Technologies (LIT) Lab explores retrieval-augmented 
                    generation techniques to support cancer patients in navigating their healthcare journey and preparing for medical consultations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was previously at Caterpillar, where I worked on sensor and physics simulations for autonomous mining vehicles. As a
                    developer, I also supported automation testing of a fleet management application and systems engineering for mine site software.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the College of Engineering, Guindy in 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I am a passionate Carnatic vocalist. Stay tuned for my music page!

                        This paper introduces a method for creating immersive stereoscopic VR videos from text descriptions. We leverage a text-to-image model to
                        establish the context, then apply Stable Diffusion to enhance visual quality and realism. Through depth estimation algorithms, we generate
                        separate views for each eye, combining them side-by-side to produce an immersive stereoscopic VR experience.
